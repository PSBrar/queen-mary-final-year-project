# Build & Run

This Folder contains the Django code. To get Django working you first need to install conda. You can find out how to do this online.

Once you have conda installed create a virtual environment with the Python version = 3.8. Ensure that PIP is installed (it normally is by default).

Once you have done this, run the following commands:

`pip install django` (version 4.0.3 specifically)
`pip install requests`
`pip install django-crispy-forms`

After you have done this, all you have to do it navigate to the root folder that this text file is in.

You will see two folders, one called app1 and one called YR3_PROJECT. All you have to do is run the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

Follow the link the in the command line and the web app should appear.
